CUSTOMER

Bamazon takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.
At first it displays all of the items available for sale. This Includes the ids, names, and prices of each product.



Then prompts users with two messages.
Once the customer has placed the order, checks if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
If not, logs "Insufficient quantity!"
However, if your store does have enough of the product, customer's oder is fulfilled.
The SQL database is updated to reflect the remaining quantity and displays total cost of customers purchase.
